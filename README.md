### About Me

I’m **vmp**, a 17 year old developer focused on **low-level systems, reverse engineering, and tooling**.  
I enjoy tearing things apart to understand how they work, then rebuilding them cleaner and faster.

I spend most of my time around:
- memory internals  
- networking  
- performance-sensitive code  
- custom tooling & loaders
